A brief description.
================================
I wanted to play with TrueOS, that's it. 


Notes from the Author:
This version was created 3 months ago.

Updated release of TrueOS STABLE 6-month release cycle. Use NFS for shared folders.

Changes: Used the nox11 version of the guest additions, and compressed the disk image, together has shaved a few hundred megabytes off the download (2.5GB -> 2.2GB)
